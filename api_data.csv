The executive said metrics like CPC or cost per impression (CPM) often fail to determine who are high-intent users and which ones are simply “low-quality traffic,” users who may not be interested in their products. “For the first time, crypto companies can accurately measure which campaigns drive engaged, high-value users, rather than wasting resources on bots or ‘normies’ who are unlikely to convert,” Nadler told Cointelegraph. In a press release, Addressable said the new Web3-native acquisition metric could help crypto projects track how many users become active participants in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, wallets or exchanges. Effect of wallet ownership on engagement, logins and conversions Source: AddressableRelated: UAE saw 41% increase in crypto app downloads in 2024 — AppsFlyerMarketing for institutional adoptionWhile CPW primarily targets retail user acquisition, the broader crypto industry is also shifting focus toward institutional adoption.On Jan. 22, Etherealize, a marketing firm backed by the Ethereum Foundation, launched to educate institutions on blockchain and Ether (ETH).

crypto,1741872600,US-Canada tariff flip-flops have Bitcoin miners on their toes,7461659,https://static2.finnhub.io/file/publicdatany/hmpimage/cointelegraph.webp,,Cointelegraph,"Bitcoin miners are adapting their business strategies as the continued trade war between the US and Canada makes energy prices and policies all the more uncertain.US President Donald Trump threatened to double his tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, leading the government of the province of Ontario to walk back its own plan to increase the cost of power exports to the US.Ontario Premier Doug Ford had promised to further increase the surcharge or even “shut off the electricity completely,” given further provocation. However, he appears to have softened his stance, at least for now. The trade war may have reached a lull, but some crypto firms are looking ahead at possible policy changes in order to protect their growth. Bitcoin miners expect changes in energy marketsBen Ganon, the CEO of Canadian Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms, told Bloomberg on March 11 that the recent energy price hikes, had they gone through, were unlikely to affect his firm’s business. Bitfarms’ operations are mostly in Quebec and British Columbia, both of which boast significant hydroelectric capacity in relation to the total provincial energy mix. Ontario, by comparison, is “not as robust of an energy market. And over the last several years, they’ve really taken a big push on cutting back on baseload capacity.”But even though Bitfarms’ energy situation may look solid for the time being, Ganon said that the tariffs “have implications for what policy and regulatory frameworks are going to look like in the future.”He said that his firm wants to see “greater access to electricity markets” as well as fewer regulations on setting up a new business or new power applications. Energy policy has been a contentious area of debate in Canadian politics, with critics accusing the Liberal government — now led by Prime Minister Mark Carney — of harming the Canadian economy with their strategies to lower emissions. Related: What Canada’s new Liberal PM Mark Carney means for cryptoGanon said: “The opportunities that are present in the United States are also present in Canada. And I think that this will all resolve itself and end up in a much more deregulated and smooth and efficient market because for years it’s been tied up in regulatory red tape.”How would a Bitcoin miner benefit from tariffs?Tariffs on goods such as steel, aluminum, and other industrial products — intended to encourage domestic production in the US—  also impact Bitcoin miners, with some effects being unexpectedly beneficial.While Ganon noted that miners can’t control the Bitcoin price, they can control their electricity costs. “One of the ways that we can do that is we can look for pockets of energy that are underutilized, that used to power heavy industry, which has been outsourced to other countries over the last 20 or 30 years.”According to Ganon, Bitfarms has operations in Pennsylvania — a “Rust Belt” state heavily affected by the outsourcing of American steel and metals industries. His firm’s assets could soon be in high demand if the US manufacturing industry were to come back from the dead.Ganon said that Bitcoin miners have been investing heavily in energy infrastructure that “used to power aluminum smelters and steel refineries and all the stuff which was outsourced.”“Now Bitcoin miners have these assets. And as the pendulum swings back to America, those assets are now in high demand.”China tariffs squeeze Bitcoin mining hardwareCanadian miners like Bitfarms may be unconcerned for now, but Trump’s tariffs on China have already begun to squeeze American crypto miners, who import hardware from China-based firms like Bitmain.According to Bloomberg, shipments of Bitcoin mining hardware from China to the US were experiencing significant delays as of February 2025. The delays reportedly were the result of the US blacklisting Bitmain’s AI affiliate Xiamen Sophgo Technologies. Heavy customs fees for inspections of Bitmain-affiliated hardware have cost US miners up to $500,000, according to Vishnu Mackenchery, director of global logistics and services at Compass Mining Inc. New tariffs could make new imports of next-gen miners to the US “completely cost-prohibitive,” according to Synteq Digital CEO Taras Kulyk.China-based mining hardware producers like Bitmain could set up operations in other countries to avoid US sanctions. During Trump’s first term, when he imposed a 25% tax duty on a number of consumer electronic goods from China, many mining hardware producers moved to Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to avoid tariffs.Bitmain even announced it would launch a US production line in December 2024 to “provide faster response times and more efficient services to the North American customers.” Bloomberg noted that the firm did not provide the exact location of its US line. Related: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says US should bring BTC onshoreTrump’s economic policies continue to be a mixed bag for the crypto industry. Wild fluctuations in trade policy and last-minute reversals have made the market difficult to predict. Elsewhere, the European Union has promised to impose counter-tariffs on the US, further threatening asset valuations. Bitcoin price chart Sept. 1, 2024 to March 13, 2025.

However, the trader couldn’t exit without tanking their own position. Instead, they withdrew collateral, offloading assets without triggering a self-inflicted price drop, leaving Hyperliquid to cover the losses.Smart contract auditor Three Sigma said the trade was a “brutal game of liquidity mechanics,” not a bug or an exploit. Hyperliquid also clarified that this was not a protocol exploit or a hack. Source: HyperliquidHyperliquid lowers leverage trading for BTC and ETHIn response to the trade, Hyperliquid lowered its Bitcoin (BTC) leverage to 40x and its ETH leverage allowance to 25x. This increases the maintenance margin requirements for larger positions on the DEX. “This will provide a better buffer for backstop liquidations of larger positions,” Hyperliquid stated. In an X post, the Bybit CEO commented on the trade, saying that CEXs are also subjected to the same situation. Zhou said their liquidation engine takes over whale positions when they get liquidated. While lowering the leverage may be an effective solution, Zhou said this could be bad for business: “I see that HP has already lowered their overall leverage; that’s one way to do it and probably the most effective one, however, this will hurt business as users would want higher leverage.”Zhou suggested a more dynamic risk limit mechanism that reduces the overall leverage as the position grows. The executive said that in a centralized platform, the whale would go down to a leverage of 1.5x with the huge amount of open positions. Despite this, the executive recognized that users could still use multiple accounts to achieve the same results.The Bybit CEO added that even the lowered leverage capabilities could still be “abused” unless the DEX implements risk management measures such as surveillance and monitoring to spot “market manipulators” on the same level as a CEX. Related: Crypto trader gets sandwich attacked in stablecoin swap, loses $215KHyperliquid sees $166 million net outflowFollowing the liquidation event of the ETH whale and the losses the HLP Vault suffered, the protocol experienced a massive outflow of its assets under management.

However, the trader couldn’t exit without tanking their own position.

Hyperliquid also clarified that this was not a protocol exploit or a hack. Source: HyperliquidHyperliquid lowers leverage trading for BTC and ETHIn response to the trade, Hyperliquid lowered its Bitcoin (BTC) leverage to 40x and its ETH leverage allowance to 25x. This increases the maintenance margin requirements for larger positions on the DEX. “This will provide a better buffer for backstop liquidations of larger positions,” Hyperliquid stated. In an X post, the Bybit CEO commented on the trade, saying that CEXs are also subjected to the same situation. Zhou said their liquidation engine takes over whale positions when they get liquidated. While lowering the leverage may be an effective solution, Zhou said this could be bad for business: “I see that HP has already lowered their overall leverage; that’s one way to do it and probably the most effective one, however, this will hurt business as users would want higher leverage.”Zhou suggested a more dynamic risk limit mechanism that reduces the overall leverage as the position grows.

crypto,1741854600,3 reasons why Ethereum can outperform its rivals after crashing to 17-month lows,7461608,https://static2.finnhub.io/file/publicdatany/hmpimage/cointelegraph.webp,,Cointelegraph,"Ether (ETH) fell 13% between March 8 and March 11 as investors moved to short-term fixed-income and cash positions, seeking safety amid a global tariff war and rising fears of an economic downturn. ETH price needs 29% gains to reclaim $2.5KMarket concerns escalated after the United States responded to Canada’s electricity surcharge with retaliatory measures.S&P 500 futures (left, magenta) vs. Ether/USD (blue). Source: TradingView/CointelegraphTypically, traders tend to overreact, increasing the likelihood that Ether will rebound faster than other assets once market sentiment improves. While some argue that risk assets are driven by inflation and economic growth data, others believe gains depend on stimulus measures and monetary expansion.Regardless of the catalyst for the next bull run, Ether price must climb 29% from its current $1,940 level to reclaim $2,500. This move will likely require increased demand from leveraged buyers, whose activity is now at its lowest point in five months.ETH 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch/CointelegraphTraders want higher prices to compensate for longer settlement periods, making a 5% to 10% annualized premium (basis rate) expected in neutral markets. When rates fall below this range—such as the current 4.5%—it signals weak bullish conviction.Excessive optimism played a role in Ether’s recent correction, as $235 million in leveraged long positions were liquidated between March 10 and March 11.The panic selling drove ETH to a low of $1,744, its lowest level since October 2023. However, several indicators suggest a potential recovery, as ETH derivatives and onchain metrics show resilience.Ethereum L2 network growsEther is trading 60% below its $4,868 all-time high from November 2021.
