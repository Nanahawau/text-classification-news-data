The executive said metrics like CPC or cost per impression (CPM) often fail to determine who are high-intent users and which ones are simply \u201clow-quality traffic,\u201d users who may not be interested in their products.\u00a0\u201cFor the first time, crypto companies can accurately measure which campaigns drive engaged, high-value users, rather than wasting resources on bots or \u2018normies\u2019 who are unlikely to convert,\u201d Nadler told Cointelegraph.\u00a0In a press release, Addressable said the new Web3-native acquisition metric could help crypto projects track how many users become active participants in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, wallets or exchanges.\u00a0Effect of wallet ownership on engagement, logins and conversions Source: AddressableRelated: UAE saw 41% increase in crypto app downloads in 2024 \u2014 AppsFlyerMarketing for institutional adoptionWhile CPW primarily targets retail user acquisition, the broader crypto industry is also shifting focus toward institutional adoption.On Jan. 22, Etherealize, a marketing firm backed by the Ethereum Foundation, launched to educate institutions on blockchain and Ether (ETH).

        "summary": "Bitcoin miners are adapting their business strategies as the continued trade war between the US and Canada makes energy prices and policies all the more uncertain.US President Donald Trump threatened to double his tariffs on steel and aluminum from 25% to 50%, leading the government of the province of Ontario to walk back its own plan to increase the cost of power exports to the US.Ontario Premier Doug Ford had promised to further increase the surcharge or even \u201cshut off the electricity completely,\u201d given further provocation. However, he appears to have softened his stance, at least for now.\u00a0The trade war may have reached a lull, but some crypto firms are looking ahead at possible policy changes in order to protect their growth.\u00a0Bitcoin miners expect changes in energy marketsBen Ganon, the CEO of Canadian Bitcoin mining firm Bitfarms, told Bloomberg on March 11 that the recent energy price hikes, had they gone through, were unlikely to affect his firm\u2019s business.\u00a0Bitfarms\u2019 operations are mostly in Quebec and British Columbia, both of which boast significant hydroelectric capacity in relation to the total provincial energy mix. Ontario, by comparison, is \u201cnot as robust of an energy market. And over the last several years, they\u2019ve really taken a big push on cutting back on baseload capacity.\u201dBut even though Bitfarms\u2019 energy situation may look solid for the time being, Ganon said that the tariffs \u201chave implications for what policy and regulatory frameworks are going to look like in the future.\u201dHe said that his firm wants to see \u201cgreater access to electricity markets\u201d as well as fewer regulations on setting up a new business or new power applications.\u00a0Energy policy has been a contentious area of debate in Canadian politics, with critics accusing the Liberal government \u2014 now led by Prime Minister Mark Carney \u2014 of harming the Canadian economy with their strategies to lower emissions.\u00a0Related: What Canada\u2019s new Liberal PM Mark Carney means for cryptoGanon said: \u201cThe opportunities that are present in the United States are also present in Canada. And I think that this will all resolve itself and end up in a much more deregulated and smooth and efficient market because for years it\u2019s been tied up in regulatory red tape.\u201dHow would a Bitcoin miner benefit from tariffs?Tariffs on goods such as steel, aluminum, and other industrial products \u2014 intended to encourage domestic production in the US\u2014  also impact Bitcoin miners, with some effects being unexpectedly beneficial.While Ganon noted that miners can\u2019t control the Bitcoin price, they can control their electricity costs. \u201cOne of the ways that we can do that is we can look for pockets of energy that are underutilized, that used to power heavy industry, which has been outsourced to other countries over the last 20 or 30 years.\u201dAccording to Ganon, Bitfarms has operations in Pennsylvania \u2014 a \u201cRust Belt\u201d state heavily affected by the outsourcing of American steel and metals industries. His firm\u2019s assets could soon be in high demand if the US manufacturing industry were to come back from the dead.Ganon said that Bitcoin miners have been investing heavily in energy infrastructure that \u201cused to power aluminum smelters and steel refineries and all the stuff which was outsourced.\u201d\u201cNow Bitcoin miners have these assets. And as the pendulum swings back to America, those assets are now in high demand.\u201dChina tariffs squeeze Bitcoin mining hardwareCanadian miners like Bitfarms may be unconcerned for now, but Trump\u2019s tariffs on China have already begun to squeeze American crypto miners, who import hardware from China-based firms like Bitmain.According to Bloomberg, shipments of Bitcoin mining hardware from China to the US were experiencing significant delays as of February 2025. The delays reportedly were the result of the US blacklisting Bitmain\u2019s AI affiliate Xiamen Sophgo Technologies.\u00a0Heavy customs fees for inspections of Bitmain-affiliated hardware have cost US miners up to $500,000, according to Vishnu Mackenchery, director of global logistics and services at Compass Mining Inc. New tariffs could make new imports of next-gen miners to the US \u201ccompletely cost-prohibitive,\u201d according to Synteq Digital CEO Taras Kulyk.China-based mining hardware producers like Bitmain could set up operations in other countries to avoid US sanctions. During Trump\u2019s first term, when he imposed a 25% tax duty on a number of consumer electronic goods from China, many mining hardware producers moved to Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to avoid tariffs.Bitmain even announced it would launch a US production line in December 2024 to \u201cprovide faster response times and more efficient services to the North American customers.\u201d Bloomberg noted that the firm did not provide the exact location of its US line.\u00a0Related: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says US should bring BTC onshoreTrump\u2019s economic policies continue to be a mixed bag for the crypto industry. Wild fluctuations in trade policy and last-minute reversals have made the market difficult to predict. Elsewhere, the European Union has promised to impose counter-tariffs on the US, further threatening asset valuations.\u00a0Bitcoin price chart Sept. 1, 2024 to March 13, 2025.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf this happens, the next major resistance lies at $90,000, which could liquidate over $1.6 billion in short positions for a retest of the $95,000 resistance level above, i.e., a 12% jump from the current price.

Related: Crypto trading volume slumps, signaling market exhaustion: AnalysisWhile Coinbase has led BTC\u2019s rally in the past, an opposing stance between the two leading exchanges might slow BTC\u2019s momentum to move swiftly through the resistance levels. Thus, for Bitcoin to reclaim higher highs at $85,000, $90,000 and $95,000 over the next couple of weeks, spot trading activity between the two major exchanges may need more collective direction.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

This increases the maintenance margin requirements for larger positions on the DEX. \u201cThis will provide a better buffer for backstop liquidations of larger positions,\u201d Hyperliquid stated.\u00a0In an X post, the Bybit CEO commented on the trade, saying that CEXs are also subjected to the same situation. Zhou said their liquidation engine takes over whale positions when they get liquidated. While lowering the leverage may be an effective solution, Zhou said this could be bad for business:\u00a0\u201cI see that HP has already lowered their overall leverage; that\u2019s one way to do it and probably the most effective one, however, this will hurt business as users would want higher leverage.\u201dZhou suggested a more dynamic risk limit mechanism that reduces the overall leverage as the position grows. The executive said that in a centralized platform, the whale would go down to a leverage of 1.5x with the huge amount of open positions. Despite this, the executive recognized that users could still use multiple accounts to achieve the same results.The Bybit CEO added that even the lowered leverage capabilities could still be \u201cabused\u201d unless the DEX implements risk management measures such as surveillance and monitoring to spot \u201cmarket manipulators\u201d on the same level as a CEX.\u00a0Related: Crypto trader gets sandwich attacked in stablecoin swap, loses $215KHyperliquid sees $166M net outflowFollowing the liquidation event of the ETH whale and the losses the HLP Vault suffered, the protocol experienced a massive outflow of its assets under management. Dune Analytics data shows that Hyperliquid had a net outflow of $166 million on March 12, the same day as the trade.\u00a0Magazine: Crypto fans are obsessed with longevity and biohacking: Here\u2019s why",

To stay safe when buying Bitcoin, you should:Only use a reputable and regulated exchange with a strong security record.Use core security features, including unique passwords and 2FA.Watch out for phishing attempts. Double-check URLs, and don\u2019t click email links or unsolicited messages.Consider moving Bitcoin into a self-custody hardware wallet to protect against exchange hacks and fraud.\u00a0Is it safe to buy BTC with a credit card?It is generally considered that buying Bitcoin with a credit card is one of the safest methods. This is because it helps to protect your wider financial information, such as direct access to bank accounts.\u00a0\u00a0You can also benefit from fraud prevention and spending limits that credit card companies offer. So, if your card details or accounts fall into the wrong hands, you will have higher levels of protection. Plus, there is even some recourse to reverse payments and have fraudulent payments struck off.\u00a0While it does offer added protection and convenience, purchases will come at a higher cost. Credit card companies typically charge higher fees for crypto transactions, and you may face restrictions on the size of Bitcoin purchases.\u00a0Many exchanges impose lower purchase limits for credit card transactions, especially for first-time buyers, which could make it less appealing for larger investments. Despite these drawbacks, the extra protection and ease of use make it a convenient option for those new to the crypto space.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
